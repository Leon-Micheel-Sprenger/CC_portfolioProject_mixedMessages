# **Codecademy Portfolio Project Mixed Messages**

This is a portfolio project to showcase intermediate Javascript knowledge.

It is a Node.js console app that generates random messages each time a user runs the program and the first time, that I versioned a project with Git/GitHub.

**Usage**
Simply type node *script.js* into the console and observe the output.
